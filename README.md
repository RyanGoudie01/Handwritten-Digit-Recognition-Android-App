## Handwritten Digit Recognition Android Application

<p>This project focuses on the development of an Android application that utilizes a neural network for handwritten digit recognition. The goal is to create an application that can accurately identify handwritten digits captured by a smartphone camera.</p>
<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>The main objective of this project is to develop an Android application capable of recognizing and identifying handwritten digits. The application will leverage a neural network model trained using the MNIST Dataset to achieve a high degree of accuracy in digit recognition.</p>
 <h3>Approach</h3>

The development of the Android application will follow the following steps:

<ul>
    <li> Model Training: Utilize the MNIST Dataset to train the neural network model. This dataset contains a large collection of handwritten digit images along with their corresponding labels. The model will be trained on this dataset to learn and recognize patterns in handwritten digits.</li>
    <li> Application Development: Implement the Android application, integrating the trained neural network model. The application will utilize the smartphone camera to capture photos of handwritten digits. The images will be processed by the neural network, which will predict the corresponding digit. The recognized digit will be displayed on the application's output screen.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This project focuses on the development of an Android application for handwritten digit recognition. By leveraging a neural network model trained on the MNIST Dataset, the application aims to accurately recognize and identify handwritten digits captured through the smartphone camera. The project follows a systematic approach, involving research, literature review, model training, application development, testing, and documentation, to ensure the successful implementation of the application.</p>
